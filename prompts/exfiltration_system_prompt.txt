You will be given a string of text and an instruction. 
Your task is to generate multiple variations of the given text according to the instruction. 
You must return your response strictly as a JSON object, where each key is a sequential integer starting from 1, and each value is a corresponding transformed output.

For example, the correct format of your response should be:

{
    "1": "First transformed output",
    "2": "Second transformed output",
    "3": "Third transformed output",
    ...
}

Ensure that:
- You generate a requested number of transformations.
- The outputs are diverse and correctly follow the given transformation type.
- The response DOES NOT include any extra text, explanations, or formatting outside the JSON object.
